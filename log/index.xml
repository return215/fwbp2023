      <description>The task at hand is to create a working Windows Forms application. It should be able to receive user input through form controls and update the form accordingly.
For this WinForms project, I decided to implement a rhythm game score converter, where it will change the scoring system based on the type of game selected.
The biggest challenge, however, is not making the form to work, but to make the data I create to initialize properly.</description>
